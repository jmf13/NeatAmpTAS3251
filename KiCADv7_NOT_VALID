This version is strictly the KiCAD v5 files opened in KiCAD v6 and saved. Then opened in KiCAD v7 and saved.
Some automatic actions have been performed by KiCAD, but extensive rechecking and possibly modifying is needed before
manufacturing new boards.

!!!! Caution : 
!!!! The silk screen for the 4 caps C25, C26, C27, C28 is wrong. it still has to be corrected
!!!! The ref for the heatsink need some rework to fit (reduce the lencth and file part of one pad). Would be better to rework.
